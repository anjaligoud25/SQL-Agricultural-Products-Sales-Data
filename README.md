# AGRICULTURAL SALES SQL ANALYSIS

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Agricultural businesses face challenges in tracking sales performance, supplier dependency, and managing inventory. Using an 8,800+ record dataset, I designed SQL queries in PostgreSQL to analyze sales trends, top and bottom products, supplier revenue share, and stock levels.

Business Problem: Lack of visibility into product sales, supplier reliance, and stock risks.

Solution: Wrote optimized SQL queries that deliver KPIs and business-focused insights.

Impact: Clear identification of best and worst-performing products, supplier concentration levels, and stockout/overstock risks.

Next Steps: Build dashboards, set up automated SQL reporting, and expand analysis with forecasting.

## Business Problem

The company struggled to answer critical questions such as:

Which products drive the highest revenue, and which underperform?

How dependent is the business on a few suppliers?

Are sales seasonal or consistent across time?

Which products are at risk of stockouts or overstocking?

Without these answers, the business risks poor planning, missed sales opportunities, and supply chain disruptions.

 ## Methodology

Conducted SQL-based exploratory data analysis (EDA) on sales records.

Developed KPI-focused queries for sales performance, supplier share, and stock monitoring.

Used aggregations, joins, CTEs, and window functions to produce actionable outputs.

 ## Skills & Tools

SQL Concepts: Joins, aggregations, GROUP BY, filtering, window functions, subqueries, CTEs

Database Tool: PostgreSQL

Business Focus: Sales performance, product portfolio, supplier dependency, inventory management

##  Results & Business Recommendations

Sales Trends: Clear month-to-month revenue view to track seasonality.

Top Products: Identified top 10 revenue-generating products for focused marketing.

Bottom Products: Found underperforming products (<2% contribution) → review or discontinue.

Suppliers: Ranked suppliers by revenue share → risk of dependency detected.

Inventory: Flagged products at stockout and overstock risk → improve stock planning.

## Next Steps

Extend SQL analysis into interactive dashboards (Power BI/Tableau).

Automate queries for weekly/monthly reporting.

Expand to predictive models for demand and inventory forecasting.

 Now all numbers/statements are generic but correct for your dataset (no fake % like “38%” unless you confirmed it). When you run queries on your dataset, you can insert actual numbers (like “Top 3 products contribute X% of revenue”) to make it even stronger.
